# Assignment 02

This assignment is an assignment tracker website made using Express.

## Deployed Site

The site can be found [HERE](https://comp2068jsframeworks-15g8.onrender.com/)

## Extra Feature

### Keyword Search
On the assignments page, you can search with a keyword, and only assignments that have that keyword in the title/description/class will come up.
### Sorting function
There are buttons to sort by date, title and class.

## Known Issues

I could not figure out how to allow users to login with github, so I just removed the button for now, but the (broken) logic remains in the backend for possiblle future updates.

## Inspiration

I used ChatGPT occasionally to explain concepts or help me with errors.
I also used it for light styling inspiration, code optimization, and generating the example data.
